Requirements:

Download EasyTransfer library: https://github.com/madsci1016/Arduino-EasyTransfer/zipball/master

RC car based on the Arduino platform. The car carries an Arduino board connected to its rear DC motors and a servo which controls the direction. There is also a status light on the car. 

The remote control is based on an Arduino nano board. Two joystics are used to control acceleration and direction. There are two master switches to turn on/off the remote control and toggle between car modes. There are also two switches to increase or decrease the maximum speed of the car, simulating the effect of gears. Finally, the remote control has an LCD screen which displays the status of the car. 

All communication between car and remote control occurs through bluetooth.
